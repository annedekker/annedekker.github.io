      <h3>The Chaos Game</h3>
      <p>The chaos game is an algorithm described by the British mathematician Michael Barnsley
        in 1988. The rules are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Decide on a polgyon.</li>
          <li>Place a point at random inside the polgyon.</li>
          <li>For every turn, choose one of the corners of the polygon at random, and move
            the point a percentage of the distance to the corner.</li>
          <li>Repeat the previous step indefinitely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optionally, you can also restrict the corner selection process, by excluding
        corners that are a certain amount of positions away from the corner(s) the point
      last moved towards.</p>
      <p>This game is fun to play because it results in pretty patterns, and some of those
        patterns are fractals.</p>
      <p>Fractals are never-ending patterns, that display the same type of structure on all
        levels (something that kind of looks like a fern on a big scale will be made of tiny
        ferns when you zoom in). Fractals are interesting because they contain indefinite
        complexity based on a simple instruction, in a way somewhat similar to early, primitive
        forms of life. Indeed, there are many fractals that look like plants. They are used
        to stimulate situations that aren't suited to exact measurement, like many in nature
        are. (Think, for example, about a coastline. If you're making a map, and you want to
        be as precise as possible, you'll have to map every centimeter by hand - and then
        start over the next day because it changed.)
        <p>When you play the game with the most famous settings (3 corners in a circle,
          move 50% of the distance) you create a fractal known as the Sierpinski triangle,
          the image you see at the top of this page.</p>
      <h3>The Program</h3>
      <p>My implementation was written in C# using WPF, and allows for a wide range of settings
        as well as exporting the result as an image.</p>
