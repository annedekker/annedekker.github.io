      <h3>The Chaos Game</h3>
      <p>This is not actually a game, it's a mathematical simulation that often generates a
        special shape called a fractal, a pattern that is similar on every scale (and therefore
        scales indefinitely). When played with the original rules the game results in a fractal
        called the Sierpinsky triangle, which you can see above.</p>
        <p>The original game goes as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Determine 3 points on a circle, with equal distances from another (so, a triangle).
          These are your corners.</li>
          <li>Place a point at some random location inside the circle.</li>
          <li>For each turn, pick one of the corners at random, and move the point half of the
          total distance towards it.</li>
          <li>Repeat indefinitely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aren't you lucky you have a computer to play this for you?</p>
      <h3>Recommended Settings</h3>
      <p>The game wouldn't be very interesting if you could only make one shape. Following are
        some good settings people have found. Of course many, many more shapes are possible,
        so have fun exploring!</p>
      <div class="imgitem">
        <img src="images/chaos01.png">
        <p>This image is not a fractal, but it's pretty nonetheless. To generate it: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set amount of corners to 6.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="imgitem">
        <img src="images/chaos03.png">
        <p>To generate this shape: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set amount of corners to 9</li>
          <li>Set distance moved to 66%</li>
          <li>Set exclude from last n corners to 1</li>
          <li>Exclude position 0, 1, and 2</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="imgitem">
        <img src="images/chaos02.png">
        <p>For this shape:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set amount of corners to 4</li>
          <li>Set exclude last n corners to 1</li>
          <li>Exclude the second position</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>A Note on Exclusion Rules</h4>
      <p>You might be wondering what "exclude last n corners" means. When choosing a random corner,
        you can tell the computer to ignore certain corners.</p>
      <p>Exclude from last n corners is the amount of corners remembered. If you set it to 2, the game
          will compare exclude positions against the last 2 chosen corners.</p>
      <p>Exclude positions are the illegal indexes. Assuming you've set exclusion to clockwise,
      every position that matches a last corner + exclude position is filtered out.</p>
      <p>So, if your last corner was 1, and your exclude position is 2, corner 3 is now no longer valid.</p>
      <p>It is possible to set the exclusion rules in such a way that there are no valid corners left. If
        you're generating but you're not getting any shape, check your exclusion rules.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>

      <p class="smallnote">Although the program is entirely functional, it is a prototype version. As such,
      there are a few small bugs that will be fixed in a later version. Sorry for the inconvience!</p>
