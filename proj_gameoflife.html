      <h3>The Game of Life</h3>
      <p>The Game of Life was invented by the British mathematician John Conway
      in the 1970s. It goes as follows:</p>
      <p>You start with an infinite grid of cells, that are either alive or dead. Then,
      to create the pattern, you form each following generation according to these rules:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a live cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies from underpopulation.</li>
          <li>If a live cell has more than 3 neighbours, it dies from overpopulation.</li>
          <li>If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours, it is born (again?).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other than that, you make no changes to the board. Aren't you happy you can have
          a computer play this for you?</p>
      <p>This type of game is known cellular automata, a simulation
        ran on a grid of cells that turn on or off based on specific
        rules, that together form a pattern. These games are studied
        because of their computational power, their useability as physics
        models, and for the study of patterns.</p>
      <p>Most seeds (another word for starting pattern) won't turn into interesting shapes,
          but some can spawn patterns that keep living for thousands of generations (these patterns
          are known as methuselahs).</p>
      <h3>The Program</h3>
      <p>My implementation of the game was written in C# using WPF. It allows you to change the
        rules and visuals as you wish, and supports turning cells on or off by clicking in the field.</p>
