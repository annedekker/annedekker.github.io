    <h2>CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE</h2>
    <p>An interesting tale about a girl who got stuck in a tower by some mean old bastard, so she couldn't do anything but let her hair grow all day.</p>
    <p>Oh - it doesn't say anywhere in the fairytale that Rapunzel only grew the hair on her head. Enjoy that mental image while I continue.</p>
    <p>So one day this kid comes along, huge hero complex, all that. And this girl, she sees him yeah, so she calls out to him and asks him, hey can you get me out of this tower?
      Which is understandable enough, towers are cool but being stuck in one for years could like really ruin your day.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this kid yeah? He says yes. And he starts climbing her hair and it's really hard and he really thinks of giving up a few times, but finally he succeeds and he's in the tower with the girl.</p>
