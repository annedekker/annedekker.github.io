    <h2>CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE</h2>
    <p>The game of life, discovered by John H Conway in the 70s, is a kind of mathematical model, known as cellular automata.</p>
    <p>Cellular automata are "played" on a grid of colored cells that evolve based on simple rules. They are useful as computational
      engines, models of physics, and for the study of patterns, but they also just look cool. You don't really play so much as apply
      the rules to make each new generation - which is quite tedious. Luckily, we have computers to do that for us, and we can just
      sit back and watchen sie blinkenlights.</p>
    <p>My implementation has been developed using C# and WPF, and is available as a portable .exe for the windows platform. It allows
    for a wide variety of user input, including clicking cells on and off, changing the game rules, and various other options.</p>
